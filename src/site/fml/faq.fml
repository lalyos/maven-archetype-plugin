    <faq id="packaging">
      <question>What packaging should I use: <code>maven-archetype</code> or <code>jar</code>? What is the difference?</question>
      <answer>
        <p><code>maven-archetype</code> packaging is available since 2.0-alpha-1: it should be used instead of <code>jar</code>, which was used
        for Archetype 1.x.</p>
        <p>Using <code>maven-archetype</code> packaging helps identifying archetypes in repositories and adds archetype related bindings to
        build lifecycle: see <a href="../archetype-packaging/"><code>maven-archetype</code> packaging documentation</a>
        for more information.</p>

      <answer>
        <p>The server id used to download the artifact is <code><i>[archetypeArtifactId]</i>-repo</code>: you have to
